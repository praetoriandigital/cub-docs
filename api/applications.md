# Applications

## Applications and Secret Keys
When some other system or site wants to integrate with Lexipol ID and 
get access to the API, we create a new Application in Lexipol ID. 
Every Application has a Public Key and a Secret Key. 
A Secret Key is something that must be known only to the Lexipol ID server and the
3rd party server, because a Secret Key gives access to all data/models stored in
Lexipol ID connected to the Application. So, if someone knows the Secret Key 
of an Application, he can access and modify all data/models connected 
to this Application.Â 

Secret Keys are not only used for API access. They are also used for jwt-token 
signatures. When Lexipol ID issues a jwt-token for a User, the jwt-token will be signed using the Secret Key of the
Application that the user logs in or registers from. You can verify the jwt-token using 
the Secret Key created for your Application.

## API access and permissions
TL;DR: Permissions of an Application are defined by the combined permissions 
of all the Users connected to this Application.

To use the LID API/Widget, you need one of the following:
* a valid user token (for LID API access on behalf of this User)
* a secret key (for LID API access on behalf of Application)
* a public key (for LID Widget)

To generate the keys, you have to create a new entry in the Application container in LID 
admin.
A user token can be acquired by the Application on user login 
(through LID Widget or LID API) or by using a reissue-token API call 
(if Application got a user token issued for another Application during SSO)

If User is connected to Application, this Application will have read/write 
access to User's data and the same set of permissions as this User. 
For example, if User is an org-admin, then Application will have permissions 
to edit Organization data and manage members of this Organization.

If a user token is used instead of a secret key for API access, 
you will have the same set of permissions as this User.  

## Data connected to the Application
Application's connection to a certain model instance determines whether Application 
will have read/write access to this instance and whether it will receive
webhooks for this instance 
([more about when and where webhooks are sent](./webhooks.md#where-and-when-webhooks-are-sent))
