# Webhooks
Status: DRAFT

## Synchronization
The API allows two systems to work together. But it doesnâ€™t solve the problem 
of keeping data in sync. To make the synchronization process smoother, 
we have webhooks: 
* All core models support webhooks that will be called for
  any object creation/update/deletion. 
* Webhooks are delivered to the endpoints specified
  in the Application settings. 
* Webhooks contain a POST body with json data in the same format 
  as an API response for this type of object.
* Lexipol ID will take care of delivery. It will keep sending webhooks until 
  a response 200 is recieved from the endpoint. It gives up only 
  after 29 retries with an increasing timeout. The overall execution time 
  should not exceed 25 hours.

## Webhooks vs. API
You have Lexipol ID API to pull info about the User when you need it. 
But what if the user changes his email in profile (Lexipol ID Widget has 
Profile UI where users can edit their info)? 
How will you know about such updates?

When something changes in the User model (or any other Model in which 
you are interested), Lexipol ID will send the latest data for the model 
that was updated to the endpoint that you provided to us (and implemented 
on your side). But only webhooks are not reliable and should be used 
together with API, because:
* there can be a race condition between webhooks when webhook can contain 
  outdated data(for example, on retries after failed requests);
* some webhooks can be lost, even the most reliable systems sometimes fail;
* webhooks can be sent unintentionally from stage environments (because 
  of misconfigurations)

So, webhooks should be considered as signals to pull the latest data 
through API. Using this most recent data pulled through API 
you could update or create your local data model.


## Where and when webhooks are sent
### Where are sent
Webhooks for particular model instance will be sent to all **enabled
WebhookEndpoints** of all Applications **connected to this model instance**.
[Here is a description of rules that determine if something is connected 
to the Application.](./applications.md#data-connected-to-the-application)


### When are sent
Webhook for model instance is sent when this instance is **created, deleted, 
or updated**. Webhook after the update would be sent **only if this update 
introduced changes to model instance**. The model instance can be changed 
through API or LID Admin.

Webhook for model instance is sent only **if this concrete model instance 
has changed, not related data**. For example, if User is added 
to the Organization (new Member created), then webhook will be sent 
only for this new Member but not for User or Organization.
