# Cubâ„¢ Widget

Cub Widget is a lightweight JavaScript application which can be installed
on any site. Key features:

* Users Login and Registration for your site, connected to 1.8m users
  database of Praetorian Digital sites network;
* Newsletter Subscription Forms for dozens of newsletters for first
  responders;
* Flexible Lead Forms with centralized processing and data export features.

The widget is implemented in pure JavaScript, and talks to a central database
directly from browser via Cub API. Basic widget integration requires no server
programming, so you can add it literaly on any site with minimal efforts.
If you need more sophisticated integration options - we have them, too.

## How it works

Widget is loaded on a page with a piece of JavaScript, like this (example):

```html
<script>
  var cubAsyncInit = function(cub) {
    // Configuration parameters
    cub.start({
      apiKey: '<your-public-API-key>'
    });
  };

  // Load Cub widget asynchronously
  (function(){
    if (document.getElementById("cub-widget-script")) {return;}
    var firstScript = document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];
    var cubJs = document.createElement("script");
    cubJs.id = "cub-widget-script";
    // See notes about widget versioning
    cubJs.src = "//cub-praetorian.netdna-ssl.com/cub-widget.js";
    firstScript.parentNode.insertBefore(cubJs, firstScript);
  }());
</script>
```

When loaded, widget adds an interaction to the web page by rendering its
components in target DOM elements which you define. Widget takes configuration
parameters via ``cub.start()`` method. Required parameter for all actions is
``apiKey``. Before you can use the widget, you have to register your
application in Cub Admin and get an API key.

Please follow these links for detailed usage instructions:

* [Users Login and Registration](./registration.md)
* [Newsletter Subscription Form](./newsletter-form.md)
* [Lead Forms](./lead-forms.md)
* [Fields docs](./fields.md)
* [Form events](./form-events.md)

## Debugging

If you want to know what Cub-widget is doing - open browser console
and enter `cub.debug()`. Cub-widget will start logging actions,
api requests/responses and other usefull stuff. Be aware that it
can affect perfomance because internally it uses deepcopy of logged items.
After `cub.debug()` call, debug logging will be active only for browser
window where it was called. To stop debug logging use `cub.debug(false)`.

## Browser compatibility

Tested vs. IE10+, Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Mobile Safari and Android Browser.

## Widget versioning

Widget versions follow [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org). You can
check current version in browser console as ``cub.version``. Changes in public
widget API or documented behavior result in major or minor version change,
and bugfixes or internal widget improvements come as patch versions.

Widget script is distributed with MaxCDN using ``cub-praetorian.netdna-ssl.com``
domain. It supports both HTTP and HTTPS. It is strongly recommended that you
always use this distribution when including widget on your site, since it comes
with automatic updates and bugfixes. Two options of widget CDN distribution are
available:

1. Always latest version - recommended if you use Lead Forms feature only:

   <https://cub-praetorian.netdna-ssl.com/cub-widget.js>

2. Fixed major and minor version number, always latest patch version -
   recommended if you use Users Login and Registration and applied custom
   styling to it:

   <https://cub-praetorian.netdna-ssl.com/cub-widget.0.26.x.js>

Second option allows you to freeze any updates to widget HTML markup, its API
and documented behaviour, however you will still receive bugfixes as patch
versions until major or minor version changes. Please note that we ship
bugfixes for latest widget version only, so if you're using fixed widget
version you should update it yourself as new versions become available.

## Please use latest widget version

We strongly encourage you to use latest widget version and upgrade
to newer version as soon as it becomes available. Technical  support and
bugfixes are provided for latest version only. Versions marked below as
'outdated' are not guaranteed to work at all.

## Troubleshooting

Cub Widget makes its best to be developer-friendly and reports its errors and
warnings into your browser console. If something goes wrong, please check
messages in browser console first. If that doesn't help, or you found a bug,
or you'd like to suggest a feature - please feel free to open an
[Issue on Github](https://github.com/praetoriandigital/cub/issues).
